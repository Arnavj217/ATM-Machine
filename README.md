The ATM Machine Project using C++ is a console-based simulation designed to replicate the basic functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). 
This project serves as a practical implementation of core C++ programming concepts such as functions, conditional statements, loops, switch-case, 
and basic file handling or arrays to store and manage user data. The objective of the project is to provide an interactive experience 
where users can perform common banking operations like checking their balance, depositing money, withdrawing cash, and viewing a mini statement, 
all through a simple text-based interface.From a programming perspective, this project demonstrates how C++ can be used to create menu-driven applications that involve 
user input, data processing, and conditional logic. The program typically starts with a login or PIN verification process for security.
